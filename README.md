  # Pawsitive Vibes &rarr; Serenium

In this GitHub repo, you'll find our Pawsitive Vibes project, a virtual pet customizable through NFT assets. This was our original project, winner at Vara Mega Hackathons, celebrated last month in Monterrey and Mexico City, respectively.

Currently, we are upgrading the project concept to make it more commercially viable, attractive to potential investors and more powerful in terms of the use of Vara Blockchain. The result of this upgrade is **Serenium**, a decentralized social media geared towards expading positive vibes and boosting meaningful connections between users. 

This project preserves the virtual pet as avatar of the users and the available customization through NFTs while generating a whole new concept of posts: challenges and questions managed through smart contracts, to take full advantage of Vara blockchain power to engage users. We give more details about this in our trailer (presentation) video.

For this Varathon season, we are submitting the code and video demo of our original project, Pawsitive Vibes, while, for the presentation video, we are submitting a trailer video of the upgraded project Serenium.
